        <div>
            <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and
                attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on
                paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more
                sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user
                interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and
                did not solve any problem.</p>

            <h4>Start with asking why</h4>
            <p>You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more effective ways of achieving goals.</p>

        <div>
            <img src="assets/img/title04.svg" alt="">
            <h4>Your ideas will have more value</h4>
            <p>By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas will be fresher and more valuable.</p>

            <h4>Design solutions with love</h4>
            <p>Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the frustration of the users and resolve to
                end it.</p>

        <div>
            <img src="assets/img/title03.svg" alt="">
            <h4>Share and show your work</h4>
            <p>As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will
                learn to accept feedback and learn from it.</p>

            <h4>Find your problem</h4>
            <p>It has to be a problem that’s personally affecting or affected you, like finding your keys, calling a
                taxi or even remembering something. Open your eyes, look around you carefully and pay close attention to
                your surroundings.</p>

            <p>It's time to look for solutions. What can you do to solve these problems? It's time to think out of the
